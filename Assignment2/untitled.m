% Given data
volatility_jpy_equity = 0.2268;  % Standard deviation of Japanese equity return in yen
volatility_currency = 0.11;      % Standard deviation of currency changes (dollars/yen)
volatility_usd_equity = 0.2268;  % Placeholder for USD-based equity volatility (will compute this)

% Assuming Covariance between r_t+1(JPY) and s_t+1 is zero, as per the question assumption

% Compute variance of Japanese equity in USD using the simplified formula
variance_usd_equity = volatility_jpy_equity^2 + volatility_currency^2;

% Calculate standard deviation of Japanese equity return in USD
volatility_usd_equity = sqrt(variance_usd_equity);

% Calculate the correlation between Japanese equity return (USD) and currency changes
cov_jpy_equity_currency = 0;  % Covariance is zero as per the assumption
correlation_usd_jpy_currency = cov_jpy_equity_currency / (volatility_usd_equity * volatility_currency);

% Display the result
disp('Calculated correlation between Japanese equity return (USD) and currency changes:');

% Compare with the original correlation from Question 3 (0.5611)
original_correlation = 0.5611;
